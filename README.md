<h1 align=center>🐍 🎮 AI Snake Game 🎮 🐍</h1>

<p>
  Engineered the classic Snake game using Pygame, incorporating Reinforcement Learning techniques and Deep Q-Learning algorithms to facilitate autonomous gameplay driven by an AI agent.

  Designed and implemented the neural network architecture necessary for game functionality using PyTorch, while utilizing Matplotlib to visualize and track the progression of the machine learning model's learning rate throughout the training process.
